## Evidence notes

- Record the relevant hook JSON, `last-success`, `last-update.log`, active `SKILL.md`, and Git commit
  before and after each event. Redact usernames and local paths if the report will be shared.
- Record a timestamp before resume, compact, workspace open, or workspace change and show that the
  instance's `last-success` and log did not change.
- A product remaining usable after a failed update is human evidence. Automated tests separately
  prove that the hook returns success and keeps the last-known-good view.
- WSL evidence does not prove that Windows-hosted Cursor reads WSL configuration.

# Deploy with Jamf Pro

Jamf Pro can deploy Team Skills with a policy that runs a stored script at user login. This recipe
is for a user-global installation on a Mac with a signed-in console user. Jamf runs policy scripts
with root privileges, so the wrapper deliberately re-enters the console user's launch context
before it runs the Team Skills installer.

Use one policy and stored script per Team Skills catalog. Repeating the same script is safe:
installation is idempotent, and each catalog keeps independent clone, state, hooks, and optional
prefix.

## Prerequisites

- The target user has signed in and has a local home directory.
- Git is installed and available as `/usr/bin/git`.
- The Mac can reach the reviewed installer host and the catalog's Git remote.
- For a private catalog, noninteractive Git authentication is already configured for the target
  user. See [Private catalogs](#private-catalogs).
- The installer file and its SHA-256 digest have been reviewed together.

Pin the installer URL to a reviewed commit rather than a moving branch. For a public GitHub fork,
an administrator can download and hash it before creating the Jamf Pro script:

```sh
curl -fsSLo team-skills.sh \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR-ORG/YOUR-REPOSITORY/REVIEWED-COMMIT/scripts/team-skills.sh
shasum -a 256 team-skills.sh
```

## Deployment script

Replace the placeholder values in the configuration block. Leave `PREFIX` empty to use the
default from the catalog's `catalog.json`; set it to a value such as `security` when multiple
catalogs need distinct skill names.

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -eu

# Pin this URL and digest to the same reviewed installer revision.
INSTALLER_URL='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR-ORG/YOUR-REPOSITORY/REVIEWED-COMMIT/scripts/team-skills.sh'

printf '%s\n' "Team Skills installed for $console_user"
```

The wrapper uses a fresh environment so an MDM agent's root-specific variables cannot redirect
the user-global installation. It downloads over HTTPS, checks the reviewed digest, passes the
root-owned file to the user-scoped shell over an already-open standard input, suppresses
interactive Git prompts, and removes only its exact temporary file. It does not use Jamf's
positional script parameters, so the standard `$1` through `$3` values do not alter the installer
command.

## Configure Jamf Pro

1. Add the configured script to Jamf Pro's computer-management scripts.
2. Open **Computers > Policies**, select **New**, and name the policy for this catalog.
3. In **General**, select the **Login** trigger and **Once per user per computer** execution
   frequency. This aligns device execution with Team Skills' user-global scope.
4. Add the stored script in the **Scripts** payload. It does not require custom parameter values.
5. Scope the policy to a small test group first. Optionally expose the same policy in Self Service
   as a manual installation or repair path.
6. Confirm the policy log and perform the checks below, then expand the production scope.

Jamf documents [running scripts from policies](https://learn.jamf.com/r/en-US/jamf-pro-documentation-current/Running_Scripts_Using_a_Policy),
including triggers, frequency, scope, and optional Self Service configuration. The Login trigger
is also listed in Jamf's [policy trigger reference](https://learn.jamf.com/r/en-US/jamf-pro-documentation-current/Triggers_for_Policies).
If Jamf invokes the script without an eligible console user, it returns an error instead of
installing under `root`. On a shared Mac, **Once per user per computer** allows each intended user
to receive an independent user-global installation.

## Private catalogs

Do not put a personal access token, password, or other secret in `INSTALLER_URL`,
`REPOSITORY_URL`, script parameters, or Jamf logs. Instead:

1. Publish the exact reviewed installer on an approved internal HTTPS artifact host, or distribute
   it through an approved Jamf package, and keep the SHA-256 check.
2. Pre-provision noninteractive, user-scoped authentication for the exact Git origin—for example,
   an HTTPS credential helper backed by the user's Keychain or a narrowly scoped SSH key and
   pinned host key.
3. Test authentication in the target user's launch context. Agent-only SSH authentication is not
   inherited by the sanitized MDM environment.

Authentication must remain available later because session-start updates fetch the managed
clone's configured `origin`. `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` makes missing authentication fail rather than
opening or waiting for a login prompt.

## Verify

On a test Mac, confirm that the target user's home—not `/var/root`—contains:

- `.local/share/team-skills/catalogs/` with one managed catalog clone;
- Team Skills links in `.agents/skills/` and `.claude/skills/`;
- preserved pre-existing skills and product hook settings.

Start a fresh Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor session and confirm that the catalog skills appear.
Codex still requires the user to review and trust a non-managed hook; MDM deployment must not
pre-approve that trust decision. See [manual verification](../manual-verification.md) for the full
product checks and [operations](../operations.md) for diagnostics and removal.

# Deploy with Mosyle

Mosyle can deploy Team Skills with a macOS Custom Command. This recipe is for a user-global
installation on a Mac with a signed-in console user. Mosyle executes management commands with
elevated privileges, so the wrapper deliberately re-enters the console user's launch context
before it runs the Team Skills installer.

Use one Custom Command per Team Skills catalog. Repeating the same script is safe: installation is
idempotent, and each catalog keeps independent clone, state, hooks, and optional prefix.

## Prerequisites

- The target user has signed in and has a local home directory.
- Git is installed and available as `/usr/bin/git`.
- The Mac can reach the reviewed installer host and the catalog's Git remote.
- For a private catalog, noninteractive Git authentication is already configured for the target
  user. See [Private catalogs](#private-catalogs).
- The installer file and its SHA-256 digest have been reviewed together.

Pin the installer URL to a reviewed commit rather than a moving branch. For a public GitHub fork,
an administrator can download and hash it before creating the Mosyle command:

```sh
curl -fsSLo team-skills.sh \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR-ORG/YOUR-REPOSITORY/REVIEWED-COMMIT/scripts/team-skills.sh
shasum -a 256 team-skills.sh
```

## Deployment script

Replace the placeholder values in the configuration block. Leave `PREFIX` empty to use the
default from the catalog's `catalog.json`; set it to a value such as `security` when multiple
catalogs need distinct skill names.

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -eu

# Pin this URL and digest to the same reviewed installer revision.
INSTALLER_URL='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR-ORG/YOUR-REPOSITORY/REVIEWED-COMMIT/scripts/team-skills.sh'

printf '%s\n' "Team Skills installed for $console_user"
```

The wrapper uses a fresh environment so an MDM agent's root-specific variables cannot redirect
the user-global installation. It downloads over HTTPS, checks the reviewed digest, passes the
root-owned file to the user-scoped shell over an already-open standard input, suppresses
interactive Git prompts, and removes only its exact temporary file.

## Configure Mosyle

Mosyle's labels can vary by product tier and interface version. In the current macOS management
workflow:

1. Open **Management**, create a **Custom Command**, and select the macOS devices workflow.
2. Paste the configured deployment script into the command/code field.
3. Configure it to run at or after user sign-in and avoid an ongoing high-frequency schedule.
   Team Skills owns its later session-start updates.
4. Assign the command to a small test device group first, save it, and send or schedule it.
5. Confirm the command result and perform the checks below, then expand the production assignment.

Mosyle lists [remote macOS scripting](https://business.mosyle.com/) among its management
capabilities. If your console uses different labels, use the corresponding macOS custom-script or
Custom Command workflow. If the command runs before login, the wrapper returns an error instead of
installing under `root`; configure Mosyle to retry after the user signs in. On a shared Mac,
arrange a run for every intended user rather than treating one device-level execution as coverage
for every account.

## Private catalogs

Do not put a personal access token, password, or other secret in `INSTALLER_URL`,
`REPOSITORY_URL`, command variables, or Mosyle logs. Instead:

1. Publish the exact reviewed installer on an approved internal HTTPS artifact host, or distribute
   it through an approved Mosyle file-delivery workflow, and keep the SHA-256 check.
2. Pre-provision noninteractive, user-scoped authentication for the exact Git origin—for example,
   an HTTPS credential helper backed by the user's Keychain or a narrowly scoped SSH key and
   pinned host key.
3. Test authentication in the target user's launch context. Agent-only SSH authentication is not
   inherited by the sanitized MDM environment.

Authentication must remain available later because session-start updates fetch the managed
clone's configured `origin`. `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` makes missing authentication fail rather than
opening or waiting for a login prompt.

## Verify

On a test Mac, confirm that the target user's home—not `/var/root`—contains:

- `.local/share/team-skills/catalogs/` with one managed catalog clone;
- Team Skills links in `.agents/skills/` and `.claude/skills/`;
- preserved pre-existing skills and product hook settings.

Start a fresh Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor session and confirm that the catalog skills appear.
Codex still requires the user to review and trust a non-managed hook; MDM deployment must not
pre-approve that trust decision. See [manual verification](../manual-verification.md) for the full
product checks and [operations](../operations.md) for diagnostics and removal.
